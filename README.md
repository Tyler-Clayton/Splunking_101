## Introduction 
In this project, I explore basic utilizations of Splunk, a SIEM tool that can provide deep visibility by manipulating raw data. It is a highly useful tool for IT ops, network ops, security ops, and business systems. After initially configuring the app and data to be used, Splunk's Indexer will sift through that data. Using Splunk's query language, SPL, to define search parameters, the particular input of data can be analyzed and extracted. Then the data can be formatted into a highly digestible and effective presentation for the target audience.
